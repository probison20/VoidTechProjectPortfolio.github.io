                <h1 class="sub-title">About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a certified computer repair technician born, raised, and currently operating in Phoenix. I primarily excel in computer 
                    software and hardware troubleshooting, but I've also been a dedicated writer since the age of sixteen. This portfolio website
                    is not only meant to bridge the gap between my passions, but also serve as an extension of my previous project portfolio website,
                    Projects with Patrick, which is linked below. I intend on keeping this website updated with my projects and accomplishments pertaining to my IT work,
                    updates with regards to my book series, and publicly available services.

                        <li><span>Computer Technician | 10/24 - Current</span><br>I currently work at Data Doctors and serve as the sole technician for our store located in Ahwatukee.  Using a suite of diagnostic tools and programs, our company knowledge base, and online resources, I resolve both
frequent and unique issues while documenting the work performed in order to educate the end user, or the customer, in a comprehensive manner. Issues I've resolved range from hardware issues, software issues, email issues, data recovery, and data migration.</li>
                        <li><span>Front of House Staff | 01/24 - 10/24</span><br>During my tenure at Iridium, I initiated a part-time position at Chick-fil-A where I served as a Front of House staff member serving at the Ahwatukee location. My duties included taking customer orders, serving customers their food,
                        maintaining store cleanliness, and assisting with a wide variety of other operational tasks.</li>

                        including SSRS and GP dynamics. Additionally served as the system administrator of our CoreIntegrator workflows integration.</li>

                        <li><span>Google Data Analytics Specialization</span><br>A little after my time at Iridium Satellites when I was still pursuing data analytics, I enrolled in the Coursera Google Data Analytics course and received the related certification upon completion; though I would say the experience more educational than anything else.</li>
                        <li><span>Arizona State University</span><br>After Desert Vista, I received a scholarship to attend ASU for a Computer Science degree. While the first two years of my time at ASU went smoothly, it was during my junior year that I began experiencing many hardships in my life with regards to my family. This accumulated and 
                        impacted my performance in school, prompting my to switch to pursuing accounting for a brief period of time before switching to a Business Communications degree. Despite everything, I am grateful for what happened as these hardships are what led my to have faith in Christ during these times of personal trial.</li>
                        <li><span>Desert Vista High School</span><br>I went to Desert Vista High School back from 2013-2017.

                        for The Sons of Fate.</li>

                    <p>I developed this responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on modern front-end design practices following GreatStack's guide. I structured multiple sections to showcase skills, projects, and contact information while implementing smooth navigation and interactive elements for an improved user experience.

                    <p>I created an ISO using Win10XPE that contains imaging software, disk surface scanning tests, and other diagnostic programs and included this in a Ventoy boot menu with MemTest and Windows 10 and 11. 
                        Additionally, I developed several visually interactive scripts using batch and powershell scripting that includes malware removal tasks, temp file removal, restore point functionality, and more.

                    <p>Following Josh Makator's AD homelab guide, I designed and deployed a Windows Server 2022 domain controller in VirtualBox, integrating a Windows 10 client to simulate enterprise operations. I configured Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP services to support domain functionality, enforced security policies through Group Policy, and automated user provisioning with PowerShell. The project resulted in a fully functional home lab environment that demonstrated practical Active Directory management, user administration, and network service configuration.</p>
