            <p>The Sons of Fate is a book series I began as early as sixteen, until a few years ago, I was writing the original manuscript which was estimated to amount to around seventy chapters. As of around a year ago, I've since began rewriting the story
                with proper formatting and have trimmed it down quite a bit. Additionally, the first volume in the series will likely be broken up into two separate parts to address the length.

                <h1 class="sub-title">The Plot</h1>
                <p>Beyond recorded history of even the earliest of civilizations existed a primordial order instituted by the Creator himself. This order is known as the Divine, a conglomeration of warriors, royalty, and legends from various races that had been chosen either be their predecessors, or by fate; the Creator's will. 
                    Of this order consists of two factions, endlessly at odds against the other. Each faction bears their own artifact endowed by the Creator: The left eye of the Creator, and the right eye of the Creator. The two sides are set to clash, and once one prevails they become an architect of their age, able to utilize 
                    the power of the Creator to alter reality to their own will to some extent. They may reign from as little as less than a week to even eons, but all ages come to an end. When their time has come, they may chose their successor, and if not them, then fate. They must then reacquire and reform their eye of the Creator, 
                    and hone their abilitites in order to beat their nemesis.<br><br>
                    Those of old recall the architect of the present age bearing the darkness; the left eye, and striking down the bearer of the right eye, yet not killing them. Instead, they receded into the shadows with the power of the Creator and hid themselves from existence, leaving the many civilizations of varying races yearning 
                    for guidance, for a savior, and yet none has come. Instead, intelligent life has been relegated to serving various idols: governments, false gods, and even architects of the past. Without an architect, the good and evil within each being have been the determinates of this age, until now. Both the architect of darkness 
                    and his divine counterpart have selected their champions, and they are best friends.<br><br>
                    Join in reading the adventures and trials of Jack Crasher and Nathan Oliver as they navigate this uncertain and cruel fate that they've been left to deal with!<br><br>
